How to Smoke A Brisket

Before cooking, trim fat to 1/4-inch thickness. Then marinate the brisket overnight (12 to 24 hours).
Sear brisket directly over medium coals or near a hot fire: 20 minutes per side. After searing, allow approximately 1 hour of cooking time per pound.
Slow cook at a low temperature of 250 ËšF. Measure cooking temperatures in a closed pit or grill with an oven thermometer set near the brisket.

When cooking over direct heat, check the temperature of charcoal or wood coals by holding the palm of your hand at cooking height. Count the number of seconds until the heat causes you to pull away: 6 seconds is the target time for low-heat coals.
Cook with the fat side up, so the juices will base and drip through the meat.
When smoking, turn the brisket every 1 to 2 hours to prevent drying the underside. Never turn briskets with a fork; the juices will run out. Instead wear insulated rubber gloves and use your hands to turn a whole brisket. If brisket is cut into large pieces, use tongs to turn.
Refrain from checking the brisket constantly. Give it time to cook.
