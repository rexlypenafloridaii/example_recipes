How to Smoke A Brisket

Before cooking, trim fat to 1/4-inch thickness.
Slow cook at a low temperature of 250 ËšF. Measure cooking temperatures in a closed pit or grill with an oven thermometer set near the brisket.

Cook with the fat side closest to the heat source to prevent burning.
Refrain from checking the brisket constantly. Give it time to cook.
Wear insulated gloves and use your hands to handle a whole brisket when done.
