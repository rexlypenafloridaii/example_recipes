How to Smoke A Brisket

Before cooking, trim fat to 1/4-inch thickness.
Rule of thumb is 1 hour per pound at 250 ˚F. At 225 ˚F it is 1.5 hours per pound. 
Slow cook at a low temperature of 250 ˚F. Measure cooking temperatures in a closed pit or grill with an oven thermometer set near the brisket.

Cook with the fat side closest to the heat source to prevent burning.
Refrain from checking the brisket constantly. Give it time to cook.
Spray with liquids every few hours to further prevent burning.
Wear insulated gloves and use your hands to handle a whole brisket when done.
